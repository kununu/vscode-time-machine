# vscode-time-machine README

Over the last few months vscode quickly grew on me and became my editor of choice. Sadly it is lacking some functionality that I deem useful, mainly:
1) using your local ssh config for sftp functionality (e.g. automatically using set up tunnels or jump servers)
2) a graphical timeline of git commits (see https://atom.io/packages/git-time-machine for example functionality in atom)

This project aims at creating PRs to existing git/ssh plugins to extend them by these (and maybe more) features or create seperate plugins.
